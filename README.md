# Kickstart-Regenerative-Shock-Absorbers
The regenerative shock absorber is a compelling engineering concept focused on energy harvesting from a vehicle's suspension system. By converting the vertical kinetic energy---which is typically dissipated as heat in conventional hydraulic shocks---into electrical energy, these systems can improve overall efficiency in electric and hybrid vehicles.

Common implementation methods for this technology include:

-   **Electromagnetic Recovery:** Using a linear generator where a permanent magnet moves through a coil during suspension travel, inducing a current.

-   **Rack-and-Pinion Systems:** Converting the linear motion of the shock into rotational motion to drive a standard electromagnetic generator.

-   **Hydraulic-Electric Systems:** Using the fluid displaced by the shock to drive a small hydraulic motor connected to a generator.

This project outlines a sustainable approach to vehicle design, specifically targeting the recapture of energy lost during impacts and road irregularities.
